# PomoVNO - A Minimalistic Pomodoro Timer

Welcome to PomoVNO! This is a simple yet powerful Pomodoro timer designed to help you stay focused and boost your productivity.

## What is the Pomodoro Technique?
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. This trains your brain to focus for short periods and helps you stay on top of deadlines.
